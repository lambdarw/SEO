# Event Evaluation Dataset

**_üê≥The whole data will be released upon publication._**

## Data Collection
We used GPT-4o-mini to generate the single-choice QA datasets for News14 and WCEP19 to assess the quality of the synopsis.  
- For the article details evaluation, we generated one question for each news article.  
- For the event integrity evaluation, we generated five descriptive questions for each event.

Here is the Statistic of the Single Choice Evaluation Dataset. (# is the symbol of `the number of').
| Type | News14 | WCEP19 |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| # Synopsis Detail  | 16,136  | 29,931  |
| # Synopsis Integrity  | 3,940  | 2,595  |
| # Total  | 16,924  | 32,526  |
