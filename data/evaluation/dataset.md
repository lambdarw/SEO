# Event Evaluation Dataset

## Data Collection
We used GPT-4o-mini to generate the multiple-choice QA datasets for News14 and WCEP19 to assess the quality of the synopsis.  
- For the article details evaluation, we generated one question for each news article.  
- For the event integrity evaluation, we generated five descriptive questions for each event.
